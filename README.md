On Kaggle you will find a Home Insurance dataset covering 2007 – 2012 policies for a home insurance company representative of customers looking for a quote on their home policy. Using Python, explore and analyse this dataset. As part of the EDA process, profile the customer base drawing out any interesting information about them, in order to then build a predictive model which helps to predict who would be best to target to reduce the number of future lapsed cases.

Areas which you should pay particular attention to are;
•	Data exploration: What are the most interesting features of the data set? What have you considered and why have you made the decisions you have done? How are customers differentiated and what are the relationships between them and lapsed cases.
•	Modelling: What process did you follow when modelling?  How have you designed your model and what did you account for?
•	What are your conclusions, proposed next steps and what else would’ve been useful to know? What would you recommend to the business in terms of targeting to reduce churn?
